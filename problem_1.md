### Problem [https://projecteuler.net/problem=1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution

Key is recognizing the pattern will repeat every 30 numbers. If you know the sum of these multiples from 0 to 30, and how many addends it's composed of, you can just sum "block-of-30s".
