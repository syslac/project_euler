### Problem [https://projecteuler.net/problem=2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution

I don't know of any clever mathematical insights here, but the Fibonacci sequence is the usual example of a recursive function that greatly benefits from caching, so that will be in the implementation.

I will just use an estimate of how far along in the sequence I'm expected to get to 4M to pre-size the cache, avoiding resizing on the fly.
