# Project Euler

Description of the solution method, and a comparison of C++ and Rust implementations, for the first 20 problems 
from the Project Euler website https://projecteuler.net/archives

### WARNING: Spoilers ahead!
Part of the fun of project Euler problems is not the code implementation, but figuring out an algorithm for a solution. 
Project authors seem to allow discussion for the first 100 problems, as stated here: https://projecteuler.net/about, 
which allows this repo to be public (I will make it private on request), but I encourage you to first try to approach
the problems unspoiled.

### WARNING: Work in progress!
Also, note that some of the solutions published may be suboptimal: this was a learning experience for me as well, and 
when I had a working and nice enough solution, sometimes I preferred keeping it instead of reimplementing the optimal 
discussed in the forums.
